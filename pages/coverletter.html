            As a motivated individual who have seen the opportunities you are providing in this job posting, I am beyond doubt interested in submitting an application for the position.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have completed my diploma studies in May 2015 as a graphic designer and I have obtained a diploma certification in Design Communications from Lasalle College of the Arts, located in Singapore.
        </p>
        <p>
           While completing my studies, I took up freelance assignments from various companies. Coding website and designing banners for print and web were part of my responsibilities as a freelance designer. About a year into freelancing, I received a job offer from a large retail company, COURTS Singapore as a web content executive. My responsibilities were to manage all assets and to ensure they meet the standards set by stake holders. Being in COURTS Singapore enables me to experience a professional, fast-paced work environment. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I am certain that with the opportunities you are providing, you will indefinitely receive a large number of applicants for this role. However I do believe with my pre-existing skills, I fit this role. With the motivation and dedication I have invested, I am committed to give my very best support to your organisational needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            I would appreciate an opportunity to make an arrangement to discuss the details of my application over an interview online or in person. While you are in consideration, I have attached my resume in line with this cover letter for your perusal.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you for your time,
        </p>
